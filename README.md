# Revolutionizing-Liver-Care-Predicting-Liver-Cirrhosis-using-Advanced-Machine-Learning-Techniques
📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting and predicting Liver Cirrhosis using advanced machine learning algorithms. It provides a user-friendly Flask-based web interface where users can input medical parameters, and the system will predict whether a patient is at risk of developing liver cirrhosis.





💡 Key Features
✅ ML-based Cirrhosis Prediction using trained classification models
📈 Preprocessed clinical dataset for better accuracy
🧠 Random Forest classifier with model optimization
🖥️ Interactive Flask Web Interface for real-time predictions
💾 Saved model (rf_acc_68.pkl) and Normalizer (normalizer.pkl) for fast deployment
📱 Responsive and simple UI for easy data entry
🎥 Demo video for end-to-end project walkthrough




⚙️ Technologies Used
Python – core scripting
Scikit-learn / Pandas / NumPy – for data preprocessing and ML model
Flask – for building the web interface
HTML / CSS / JS – for frontend styling
Jupyter Notebook – for model training and evaluation
